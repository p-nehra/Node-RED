# Node-RED

This simple project shows the Temperature control system using Node-RED with CLICK PLUS PLC, CM5 HMI, and MySQL!
This is not perfect but it shows how we can integrate the Node-RED and other Industrial equipment to control and log the different parameters.
In Node-RED, I used the Dark Theme in the Dashboard which will effect your system.
